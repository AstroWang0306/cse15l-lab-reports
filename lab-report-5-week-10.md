# Lab Report5:

I found the results by using vimdiff and other commands that can write the result into a text file.
 1. `bash script.sh > result.txt` , I used this command in two different directories, which gave me two different results.
 2. `vimdiff my-markdown-parser/result.txt markdown-parser/result.txt`, use vimdiff to check if there were some diferent results. 

 To verify the correct results, I used the website [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/), which was provided by previous labs.
