  The coommand you have to enter: `ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, 
  
  "zz" depends on your account name, each student has his/her own account name:

4. Moving Files with `scp`:

    If you have already logged into SSH, you have to log out in order to copy your file from your PC. 
    
    Reminder: Please go to the directory where you want to copy the file, otherwise, you might get errors since there is no 
    such file in the directoy
    
    As the below picture, I stored my file WhereAmI.java on the Desktop. so I have to `cd Desktop` to find my file
    
    Then, use the coomand to copy the fily to SSH: `scp WhereAmI.java cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/`
    
    After entering this command, it will require to enter the password, which is your SSH password. 
    
    When logging into your SSH, enter `ls` and should see your file was copied.

6. Optimizing Remote Running

    a. By adding a command after `ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"`, you will be logging in and see the listed files you have. 
    
    Reminder: You can use up-arrow to get the previous command you havr entered and save some time.
