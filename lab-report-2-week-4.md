# Lab Report 2:

The symptom we found was a infinte loop. When we tried to run the test-file.md there is nothing in the output becasue the program would not break the while loop and print out the result.

## Here are three changes we made:

### 1st Change:

At the first time running the code, we did not know there was an infinte loop. However, the program was able to run and to be compiled. The first change was adding a print statement at the end of the while loop and seeing what did the program print out. Please see below screen shot.
